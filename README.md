  It consider if the current url starts with http or https protocol, and if contains www or not, then add the backend address

  ```javascript
  var url_location = window.location;
  var http_https = "https://";
  var www = "";

  if (url_location.protocol) {
    http_https = url_location.protocol + "//";
  }

  if (url_location.host.startsWith("www.")) {
    www = "www.";
  }

  var url = http_https + www + "sarabandalatina.it/"; // edit this line: address url of the application
  ```

- **config.php**
  This file is inluded at the start of each php file. <br>
  It is used to configure general PHP settings and the connection with DB:

  - variables to connect to DB
  - connection to DB
  - start session

  ```php
  // connection data
  $server = "localhost";            // edit this line: server address
  $username = "sarabandalatina";    // edit this line: username
  $password = "sarabandalatina";    // edit this line: password
  $db = "sarabandalatina";          // edit this line: name of the database

  // start connection to DB
  try {
      $dbh = new PDO("mysql:host=$server;dbname=$db", $username, $password);
      $dbh->exec("set names utf8");
  }
  catch (PDOException $e) {
      echo "Connessione database fallita: " . $e->getMessage() . "\n";
      exit;
  }
  $dbh->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
